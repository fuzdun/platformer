New render pipeline:

- load level data into level_geometry array
- load vertices into one array
- load indices of static geometry into arrays per shader as before
- for dynamic geometry, store indices in component 

- draw all static geometry using static vertices + indices arrays
- iterate through dynamic geometry, updating indices buffer per object, and setting transform uniform and shader before drawing
