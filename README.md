Working titles: **Durian**, **Echinocyte**, **Aka Uni**

An arcade platformer platformer inspired by Thumper, Hyper Demon and Jeff Minter games. The goal is to induce a platforming flow state of nonstop forward momentum, using clear audiovisual gameplay cues set against progressive levels of psychedelic obfuscation. The game will feature a reactive soundtrack mixing live drums, cavernous ambient and jungle

Built with Odin, SDL and OpenGL

Currently in active development, playable soon. Planned for release sometime in 2026
