Working title: **Durian**

An arcade platformer platformer inspired by games like Thumper, Hyper Demon and Space Giraffe. The goal is to induce a platforming flow state using clear audiovisual gameplay cues set against progressively more psychedelic obfuscation. The game will feature a reactive soundtrack mixing live drums, cavernous ambient and jungle/DnB

Built with Odin, SDL2 and OpenGL

Currently in active development, playable soon. Planned for release sometime in 2026
