lissajous noise
radial blur


instead of rendering surfaces all the time, maybe render particles that condense and expand as objects warp into existence and shrink when they are in a transparent state


NEW DITHER EFFECT
- transform frag into screen space, floor to some resolution
- sample value at this coord from dither texture
- use unproject to get 3d line passing through floored screen coordinate
- get intersection of line and triangle plane
- use triangle vertices positions and uvs to barycentrically calculate uv of intersection point
- calculate color based on this uv
- get distance from player, floored based on number of desired shades
- add sampled dither value, multiplied by shade, to transparency
